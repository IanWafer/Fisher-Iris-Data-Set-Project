Introduction

The Iris data set is a well known database in pattern recognition originally created by R.A. Fisher. It is a multivariate collection of four attributes for 3 flowers. The attributes it covers are the length and width of the sepal and the length and width of the petal in four sperate columns and each row is associated with a seperate class of the Iris plant. 

The Iris classes covered are the Iris Setosa, the Iris Versicolout and the Iris Virginica. Each class of plant has 50 instances of measurements taken.
