Project Description

This is a project set out by Ian Mcloughin for the programming and scripting module number 52445.  It entails reseaching the Fisher Iris data set and then writing documentation and code in the python programming language based on that research. It is expected to break the project down into smaller tasks and treat it as if we are to explain to out work colleagues what the dat set investigation has shown.

Introduction

The Iris data set is a well known database in pattern recognition originally created by R.A. Fisher. It is a multivariate collection of four attributes for 3 variations of the Iris flowers. The attributes it covers are the length and width of the sepal and the length and width of the petal in four sperate columns and each row is associated with one of the 3 class' of the Iris plant. 

The Iris classes covered are the Iris Setosa, the Iris Versicolout and the Iris Virginica. Each class of plant has 50 instances of measurements taken in the data set.
